GStreamer Motion Detector Plugin
================================

This is a simple GStreamer plugin that detects motion in a video
stream in a Gstreamer pipeline.  The element has one sink pad and
one source pad, both only support 24-bit RGB formats.

Connect the element inline with your video stream and either watch
the elements `notify::motion-detected` signal or watch for application
bus messages containing motion information.

The plugin uses OpenCV to find moving blobs against an averaged
background scene.  It's not super-robust but it's still quite
accurate.  You can tweak the element properties to improve detection
somewhat.

Here's a sample pipeline:

	$ gst-launch -v --gst-plugin-path=$PLUGIN_PATH \
          autovideosrc ! \
          video/x-raw-rgb ! \
          motiondetector draw_motion=true rate_limit=500 ! \
          ffmpegcolorspace ! \
          queue ! \
          autovideosink
